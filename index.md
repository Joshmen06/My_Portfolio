# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/Joshmen06/Linear-Regression-Project/blob/main/3_Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**53%** accuracy](https://github.com/Joshmen06/Linear-Regression-Project/blob/main/3_Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Linear Regression with high prediction accuracy through iteration

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**92%** accuracy using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Joshmen06/Brest-Cancer-Prediction/blob/main/2_Logistic_regression_excercise.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Hand Written Digits Recognisation](https://github.com/Joshmen06/Deep-Neural-Networks-hand_writting_recognition_project/blob/main/step5_1_hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/handWrittenDigits.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of hand written digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Nural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**98%** using **10** epochs](https://github.com/Joshmen06/Deep-Neural-Networks-hand_writting_recognition_project/blob/main/step5_1_hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
- Trained model with 10 epochs. ***
